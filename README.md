## Overview of the Analysis  

W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. He wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, so he can determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

## Results 

December has a higher potential to be colder than in June. The minimum temperature that month was 56, while the minimum temperature in June was 64 

The standard deviation in December is higher than in June. This means that the weather is less consistent  

The average temperature in June is higher than in December.  

## Summary  

In summary, June is generally warmer and more consistent in weather than December. But this summary shows that they do not differ immensely. Their mean, max and median are very close in numbers. One additional query I would perform is getting the summary for the precipitation. And perform a query to gather information on activity in stations during each month.
